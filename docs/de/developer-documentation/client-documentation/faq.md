### Q: Will Lethean project make me anonymous? ####
There are lot of next dependencies which you *MUST* follow to be anonymous. Refer to [tor](https://www.torproject.org/). I a short review, your browser, your OS and all other tools around can be used to identify you. 
At least, use dedicated browser with anonymous mode enabled.
